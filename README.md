Some libraries used that deserves mentioning.

- [Prime React](https://www.primefaces.org/primereact/) - The UI components used in the project on top of free template Sigma.
- [React Tracked](https://react-tracked.js.org/) - Simple and fast global state manager. Eliminate unnecessary re-renders.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.
- [React Calculator](https://codepen.io/mjijackson/pen/xOzyGX) - Modified to adjust my tools sidebar.

Additionally I have added a custom template in the `extra` folder. The template is designed and created solely by me. The name is **blueberry-orange**. Which is **not free** to use or copy without permission.
